TinyOS - Cooja

Homework3.h Header files contains the structure of BROADCAST message, 
composed by SenderID and conunter.
I created only one OS for all the 3 motes, the separation of the different behaviours is driven by TOS_NODE_ID, with Switch Case statement. 
In the Homework3C.nc is instantiated a local counter which is incremented every time the timer fires, 
and for syncronization issues it is overrided by new the incoming message's counter. I used "printf" to Serial function to print out Debugging messages.
